## Introduction

This repository contains the Seoul Bike Project completed by Au Yi Teng, Chen Qiao Leng, and Wan Li Xin Yuan. In this project, we analyze bike rental data from Seoul to understand patterns and make predictions using various machine learning models.

## Necessary Imports
numpy
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
sklearn

## Cleaning the Data

- Converting Data Types
- Remove Non-operational Rows
- Dropping the Date Column

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Number of Bike Counts by Season
  - Preliminary Analysis
  - Distribution of Seasons
  - After Neutralisation
- Average Rental Count by Day Type
- Rented Bike Count during different attributes with respect to Hour
- Correlation

## Core Analysis

### Scatter Plot

Scatter plot of features against the target variable.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression analysis to predict bike rental counts based on temperature.

### Decision Tree

Decision tree analysis to predict bike rental counts based on features.

### Random Forest

Random forest analysis for predicting bike rental counts.

For detailed code and analysis, please refer to the SC1015.ipynb notebook.
